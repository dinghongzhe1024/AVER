#### What was already done in literature?

This paper presents a facial expression recognition framework using LEMHI-CNN and CNN-RNN. The integrated framework incorporates facial landmarks to enable attention-aware facial motion capturing and utilize [neural networks](https://proxy.library.spbu.ru:2068/topics/computer-science/neural-networks) to extract spatial-temporal features and classify them, which achieves better performance than most of the state-of-the-art methods on CK+, MMI and AFEW dataset. Our main contributions are threefold. Firstly, we proposed an attention-aware facial motion features based on MHI. Secondly, we introduced temporal segment LSTM to video emotion recognition and improve it. Thirdly, we integrated two models with late fusion based on random weight search.

#### What was possible to do?

How to improve the performance on wild expression dataset, such as AFEW, needs to be further explored.

### Algorithms

1. #### Cross temporal segment LSTM

2. Integrated framework of LEMHI-CNN and CNN-RNN
